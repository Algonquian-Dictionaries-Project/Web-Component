# This file is used by the build system to adjust CSS and JS output to support the specified browsers below.
# For additional information regarding the format and rule options, please see:
# https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#queries

# For the full list of supported browsers by the Angular framework, please see:
# https://angular.io/guide/browser-support

# You can see what browsers were selected by your queries by running:
#   npx browserslist

# This file is essentially useless, because Angular refuses to support
# anything older than the default top 20% browsers, which are:
last 2 Chrome versions
last 1 Firefox version
last 2 Edge major versions
last 2 Safari major versions
last 2 iOS major versions
Firefox ESR

# Safari <14 cannot be supported by something deep in the bowels of
# Angular (executeListenerWithErrorHandling, whatever that is)

#last 3 Safari major versions

# This currently breaks because Angular i18n can't support ES2015

#iOS 12.1

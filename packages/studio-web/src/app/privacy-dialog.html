  We have built this tool with the top goal of respecting your privacy and data
  sovereignty. The audio that you use on this site
  <b>does not get uploaded anywhere</b>. It will stay on your computer. The text
  you use for this Read Along will be uploaded over an encrypted connection to a
  server for preprocessing. The text is not saved and is not used for any other
  purpose. Using this site means that you agree for your data to be used in this
  way.

<div i18n="Text for analytics" mat-dialog-content>
  Almost every website you visit will collect data about you using Google
  Analytics, which comes with a variety of privacy concerns. We have opted to
  use <a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy">Plausible Analytics</a> instead
  which incurs a cost for us but ensures that the data gathered about your visit
  here is not sold. We use this data to determine which devices are accessing
  our site and to make improvements accordingly, however you can opt out
  entirely by clicking the "Opt Out" button below.

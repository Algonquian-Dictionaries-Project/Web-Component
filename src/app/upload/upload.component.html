            Upload data to start creating your ReadAlong</h2>
        <p>In order to make a ReadAlong, we need 3 different things. We need some <b>text</b>, some corresponding
            <b>audio</b>, and a way of turning the writing system of your language (AKA <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography'>Orthography</a>) into the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet'>International Phonetic Alphabet
                (IPA)</a>. If you're not a linguist, don't worry! This sounds scarier than it is, and, once you make the map between your language's writing system and the IPA once, you don't have to do it again!

                <p>The reason ReadAlong Studio works is because it leverages technologies that have been created for English. Usually, need a certain amount of data is needed in order to do the alignment that ReadAlong Studio does. But, instead of that,
                    your ReadAlong is first converted to a very approximate English pronounciation. Then, ReadAlong Studio can do the alignment based on that, and conveasdfasdfrt it back into your language once it's done. If your language isn't supported

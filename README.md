> Web application for audiobook alignment for Indigenous languages!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.4. This web application is a web interface for end-to-end audio/text aligner. It is meant to be used together with the API from [ReadAlong-Studio](https://github.com/readalongs/Studio) to assemble the text required for alignment.

## Background

This web application is intended to be a graphical version of the [ReadAlong Studio command line interface](https://github.com/ReadAlongs/Studio) for creating interactive "read-alongs". 

### Data Sovereignty

We have built the tool with Indigenous data sovereignty in mind ([see here for more info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fodGN4kaEcI)). As such, we are using the JavaScript version of [soundswallower](https://github.com/ReadAlongs/SoundSwallower) which runs on the users' computer without uploading audio to a server. Text data will be sent (encrypted) to the ReadAlongs API but is not stored or saved to disk on the server and is only used for creating the ReadAlong.

### Northeastern University collaboration

The design of the interface and CSS styling was developed by two group of students in Michael Running Wolf's Spring 2022 Foundations of Software Engineering course. We are very grateful for both groups' hard work and contributions. Group 1 developed the design that was eventually chosen for this project.

Group 1: 
  - Siqi Chen
  - Kwok Keung Chung
  - Koon Kit Kong
  - He Yang

Group 2:
  - Yuzhe Shen
  - Rui Wang
  - Zirui Wang
  - Xuehan Yi
  - Zhenjie Zhou
